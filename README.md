# hedgehog-variability


This repository contains the notebooks to analyze the single-cell data from the hedgehog-variability project.


## analyze.md

This notebook contains code use to analyze the initial single-cell RNA-seq experiment with samples from 0, 17 and 30 hours.

## analyze_prrx1_combined.Rmd

This notebook contains code used to analyze the single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Dox induced and uninduced cells at 0, 19 and 30 hours.

## mark_competent_cells.Rmd

This notebook contains code that marks cells from the first experiment as fast and slow responders and finds differentially expressed genes between them

## run_garnett_classifier.Rmd 

This notebook contains code to learn the features of the fast-responders and slow-responders and applies the model to predict which Dox induced and uninduced cells look like fast responders and slow responders.
